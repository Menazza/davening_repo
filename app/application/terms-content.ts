export const PROGRAMME_TERMS = `Programme Conduct & Behaviour Expectations
Participation in the programme is conditional upon maintaining appropriate conduct and behaviour consistent with the values of the shul and the purpose of the programme.

Examples of behaviour that may be considered unsuitable include, but are not limited to:
- Failure to attend Shacharis as required by the programme
- Disruptive behaviour during davening
- Disrespectful conduct towards gabbaim, rabbanim, staff, or fellow participants
- Failure to follow reasonable instructions or programme guidelines
- Behaviour that brings the programme or the shul into disrepute
- The programme organisers retain full discretion to assess conduct and determine suitability for participation.

Discretion & Removal
The organisers reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to suspend or remove any participant from the programme at any time if they determine that the participant is no longer suitable, whether or not the conduct in question is specifically listed above.

Interviews & Ongoing Review
I acknowledge that:
- Acceptance into the programme is not guaranteed.
- An interview may be required as part of the application process.
- Additional interviews or reviews may take place at any time during participation in the programme.

Employment Status
I acknowledge that this programme does not constitute employment. It is a community-based initiative dependent on participation and adherence to programme guidelines. Participation is reviewed on a monthly basis, and reapplication is required in order to continue in the programme.

Further Specific Behaviour Requirements (including, but not limited to):
- No making or drinking coffee during the Amidah, its repetition, Torah reading or Haftorah reading.
- No talking during the Amidah, its repetition, Torah reading or Haftorah reading.
- If learning or speaking, this must immediately cease when the Chazzan begins (preferably a minute before the Chazzan commences), in order to minimise disturbances.
- The only acceptable use of a cellphone or other electronic device during the service or learning is for use of the service or learning (e.g. using a phone as a siddur or for learning Torah).
- Please do not gather in the near vicinity (within 10 metres) of the Shul to talk during services as this will cause disturbances.
- If attending Shul on Shabbos, participants should participate fully in the service so as not to disturb the community.

Breaks
I acknowledge that the programme may go on seasonal breaks from time to time. This may result in longer breaks during which incentives do not apply.

Acceptance of Decisions
I accept that all decisions relating to acceptance, continuation, suspension, or removal from the programme are final and will not give rise to any claim, dispute, or expectation of continued participation or payment.

Dress Code
When inside the shul, participants must wear long pants and closed shoes. It is acceptable to change into long pants at the shul.

Visiting Other Shuls
When visiting other Shuls where talking is the norm, participants are still expected to refrain from talking.

Learning
The minimum time required to complete the learning incentive will be variable based on the time of year. During university term it will be 15 minutes. During the holidays it will be 45 minutes. This learning time can be completed before or after davening, but talk should be kept in the context of learning for the entire minimum required time.

Grievances
If any issues arise (whether involving another participant, payments, or any other matter), a Google Form will be provided to escalate the concern. All submissions made through this platform will be kept anonymous and will only be shared with individuals required to resolve the issue. Grievances may only be escalated via the Google Form and may not be publicised.

Leading the Service
Participants who are able are expected to be willing to learn how to lead the shul service and, once able, to lead it. This may be done by leading portions of the service rather than the entire service.

Behaviour towards others
Participants are expected to treat others in a kind pleasant way.

Payment Incentives
Payment incentives will be processed weekly; however, payments may occasionally be delayed to ensure that the correct funds are paid to the correct participants. Payment works as follows per day: R100 for attendance, R100 for being 5 minutes early, R100 for learning for the minimum required time as specified above. This makes a total of R300 per day if all incentives are completed.`;
